### Content
This dataset includes 43,170 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2019. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men's full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team, U-23 or a league select team.

### Approach
I performed some data wrangling, exploratory analysis and some in-depth analysis to come up with insights and answer some questions including:
* How the number of games increased over years?
* games density over months
* teams with the most games played at home
* teams with the most games played away
* Highest numbers of goals scored
* most frequent results
* most winning teams
* percentage of games that went to penalties
* most winning teams with penalties
* How big of advantage playing at home
* Does it make any difference being called a home team even if the game played on a neutral field?
